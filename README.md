### AI-DocGen: Générateur de documentation intelligent

This project, conducted as part of the end-of-year engineering project in Artificial Intelligence at
EPI-Digital School, aimed to develop a solution based on Natural Language Processing (NLP)
to facilitate automatic code documentation generation. This solution aimed to allow developers
to devote more time to project design and improvement by automating a task that is often tedious
and time-consuming. To achieve this goal, we utilized LLM models and explored the use of
quantization to optimize our solution. The results obtained demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in simplifying the code documentation process, thus opening up new perspectives for
software development.
